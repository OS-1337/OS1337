#   OS/1337
### Code of Conduct
This should be self-explanatory.

---

##	TL;DR
###	*"Don't be an asshole!"*

We expect a professional attitude and focus at hand and won't tolerate discrimination and personal attacks of any kind in this project.

- We expect each and every contributor to treat others as they want to be treated.

- This includes both online, offline, on- and off-platform actions and communications in the context of the project and/or with project contributors.

Failure to do so will, depending on the severity and whether or not the violator is a repeat offender range from one of the following measures:

- informal warning
- formal & public warning
- revocation of privilegues and/or access
- temporary timeout / ban
- permanent ban from the project and it's associated infrastructure
- removal of parts or all contributions of the offender to the project

The OS/1337 project may also seek other options if necessary to enshure the integrity, security, safety and health of it's members and contributors at the expense of the violator.

The Code of Conduct is exclusively Subject to Laws of and within the Federal Republic of Germany and subsequent treaties that apply. This includes for example:
- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
- The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons
- General Non-Discrimination Law of the Federal Republic of German (AGG)

NOTE: The list is not exhaustive!
