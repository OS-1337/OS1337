### How to Contribute
How to get your contribution accepted?

---

####	1.	Please check first if what you want to report [is already noted as issue](https://github.com/OS-1337/OS1337/issues).
######	This lets us all avoid redundant work.
If you want to work on an issue or actually want to make a fix, please post a comment and if you already have a fix, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/OS-1337/OS1337/pulls) and link to it.
- This way it's easy to link these together, assign contributions and make collaboration much easier.

####	2.	Please check first if there's already a [pull request](https://github.com/OS-1337/OS1337/pulls) for the issue.
######	Same here: We don't want to do redundant work.
Chances are that if there is no [issue linked](https://github.com/OS-1337/OS1337/issues) and noone assigned to said issue, that it's not being worked on.
- Feel free to get involved then and let everyone know in the comments if you want to do so.

####	3.	Feel free to submit your contribution.
######	We're happy about those.
Please be mindful that we may expect certain standards, like our [Code of Conduct](/docu/code-of-conduct.md) to be followed.

To enshure consistency for everyone, we're expecting certain Standards to be followed:
- No proprietary file formats allowed - period!
  - Code and Tables are to use *Tabs, not Spaces*, for layouting purposes.

- For build scripts, we stick with [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) as of now to simplify both the design and reduce dependencies to a minimum. We may transition to [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)) or other shell / programming language if deemed necessary and useful.
  - It is desireable and stated goal to be able to build OS/1337 under itself long-term!

- We prefer *code readability* above *performance* and *hyper-optimization*!
  - It is more important this project is maintainable than that we save the last bit of our toolchain.
